# StarPU: A Unified Runtime System for Heterogeneous Multicore Architectures

StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous multicore
machines. While many efforts are devoted to design efficient computation kernels
for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS kernels on GPUs),
StarPU not only takes care of offloading such kernels (and
implementing data coherency across the machine), but it also makes
sure the kernels are executed as efficiently as possible.

For any questions regarding StarPU, please contact the starpu-devel
mailing-list at starpu-devel@inria.fr.
